      <p>
        I’m currently pursuing a Bachelor of Arts in Digital Media – Web Design at the University of Central Florida.
        My program blends design thinking, front-end development, and creative storytelling — and it’s shaped me
        into a well-rounded digital creator ready to take on real-world projects.
